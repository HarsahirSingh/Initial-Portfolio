## 👋 About Me

I'm an ITSM Manager at Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP), where I bridge crisis leadership and cloud infrastructure expertise. My unique background in fire prevention and social services gives me an edge in managing high-pressure IT incidents — I focus on the human side of outages: clear communication, calm leadership, and bringing teams together when systems fail.

**Key Highlight:** During my co-op at HOOPP, I helped develop their major incident coordination function. They created a permanent manager role and invited me back without me ever applying.
